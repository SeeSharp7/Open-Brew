Let us design a new json standard for brew receipes and their automation

Dear homebrew friends. I'm new to this allnew craftbeer and homebrew community. And the last time I've read a lot about it. So much happened in the last years. But I still miss an offical standard for brewing receipes. There are so much cool projects (such as craftbeerpi, kleiner brauhelfer and so on) but all of them use an individual data exchange format. Let us design a worldwide standard format in json schema for distributing brew receipes across the world. Contributors welcome!

Requirements:
- Json as state of the art format
- Open Brew format as Json Schema (for easy validation)
- Possibility to define one or more receipes in one document (i. e. base object ist array)
- Receipe Name, Author and license
- Brewsteps can be defined completely dynamic
- Support for multiple measurements, etc.
- Multi language support
