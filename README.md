Let's design an international json-based standard format, used for the exchange of beer brewing receipes

Hey homebrew friends out there,  
there's a revolution in the beer brewing scene. Now everyone has the ability to brew a custom beer. Everyone can make own experiences and develop great receipes. The last time I've read a lot about it. So much happened in the last years. But I still miss an offical standard for brewing receipes: There are so much cool projects (such as [craftbeerpi](https://github.com/Manuel83/craftbeerpi "Goto craftbeerpi"), [kleiner-brauhelfer](https://github.com/Gremmel/kleiner-brauhelfer "Goto kleiner-brauhelfer") and so on) but all of them use individual data exchange formats like sql and so on. Let us design a worldwide standard format in json schema here. Let's make the default for home brewing automation. Let's make it possible, sharing brew receipes across the world. Contributors welcome!

#### Steps to version 1.0.0
- Finalize the json example_open_brew_v_0_0_1
- Extract json schema from example
- Add description, required fields, enum values
- Add GNU GPL License to repo
- Release version 1.0.0

#### Requirements:
- Json Schema as definition format
- Versioning for further development
- Multi language support
- Definement of multiple receipes in one document
- Free definition of brew steps
- Support for multiple units, etc.

#### Thoughts for future versions
- Swagger json definition
- Central online portal for all recipes worldwide
