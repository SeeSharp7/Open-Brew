Let us design a new json standard for brew receipes and their automation

Dear homebrew friends. I'm new to this allnew craftbeer and homebrew community. And the last time I've read a lot about it. So much happened in the last years. But I still miss an offical standard for brewing receipes. There are so much cool projects (such as craftbeerpi, kleiner brauhelfer and so on) but all of them use an individual data exchange format. Let us design a worldwide standard format in json schema for distributing brew receipes across the world. Contributors welcome!
