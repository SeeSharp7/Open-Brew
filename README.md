Let us design a new json standard for brew receipes and their automation

Dear homebrew friends. There is a revolution in the beer brewing scene. Now everyone has the ability to brew a custom beer. Everyone can make own experiences and develop great receipes. The last time I've read a lot about it. So much happened in the last years. But I still miss an offical standard for brewing receipes. There are so much cool projects (such as craftbeerpi, kleiner brauhelfer and so on) but all of them use an individual data exchange format. Let us design a worldwide standard format in json schema for distributing brew receipes across the world. Contributors welcome!

#### Requirements:
- Json Schema as definition format
- Versioning for further development
- Multi language support
- Possibility to define one or more receipes in one document
- Free definition of brew steps
- Support for multiple measurements, etc.

#### Thougths for future versions
- Swagger Json definition for easily defining REST-Apis

Have a look at the [JSON Example](https://github.com/SeeSharp7/Open-Brew/blob/master/example_open_brew_v_0_0_1.json "JSON Example for Open Brew Version 0.0.1")
